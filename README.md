# Xapo - Android Test-Code

The main idea of the test project is to build an Native Android App that has 2 Screens:
1. A list of trending Github repositories of android
2. A simple “Detail View” of the detail information of the repository, been accessed when
the user taps on one of the repositories of the list.


### Try to:

- Use Retrofit2 for the network call.
- Java or Kotlin (kotlin preferable)
- Don’t use a base generic project as base for this one.

# Development

### Chosen Architecture

I have chosen MVP in order to develop this task due to:

- Not much business logic
- It easy to test
- it easy to implement

### TODO list:

- UI enhancements
- Write more unit tests
- Write Instrumentation tests
